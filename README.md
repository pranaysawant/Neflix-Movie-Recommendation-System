# Neflix-Movie-Recommendation-System
This project aims to build a movie recommendation mechanism within Netflix. The dataset I used here come directly from Netflix. It consists of 4 text data files, each file contains over 20M rows, i.e. over 4K movies and 400K customers. All together over 17K movies and 500K+ customers!
